# Multiple Antenna Selection and Successive Signal Detection for SM-based IRS-aided Communication

This is a simulation program of Multiple Antenna Selection (MAS) in IRS,  the proposed design is able to improve the number of bits conveyed in each transmit time. As a complement to this method, we also propose a Successive Signal Detection (SSD) to reduce the complexity of the exhaustive search of the received signal, so that with SSD the detection process can be done faster but with reliable quality.

This compute capsule uses:
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Quick Start Guide
There are 4 kinds of simulations in this capsule. For each simulation program, you can change the hyperparameter such as N, Nr, M, Ns, SNR, etc. Run the program and you will get the SNR and the plot results.
